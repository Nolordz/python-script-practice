        <p>Well, it’s never too late. You’re never too old nor too young to start learning how to program.
Why Python is my first choice into programming?
1. <strong>Easy-to-Learn</strong>:
Python code is often 3-5 times shorter than Java, and 5-10 times shorter than C++. But while Python is easy to learn in itself.The use of white space and common expressions has eliminated the need for variable declarations and curly brackets. Python also requires less code to complete basic tasks, making it an economical language to learn...</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>My Stepping Stone</strong>:
Python is an object-oriented language, just like Javascript, C++, C#, Perl, Ruby, and other key programming languages. For people like me, planning to become software developers, learning this type of programming in one area will help you adapt easily in other environments.</p></li>
<li><p>How About Some Raspberry Pi?
Raspberry Pi is a card-sized, inexpensive microcomputer that is being used for a surprising range of exciting do-it-yourself stuff such as robots, remote-controlled cars, and video game consoles. With Python as its main programming language, the Raspberry Pi is being used even by kids to build radios, cameras, arcade machines, and pet feeders! </p></li>
<li><p>Python on demand !!
Python had the largest year-on-year job demand growth — at 19% — as of March 2013. Notably, the overall hiring demand for IT professionals dipped year over year by 5% as of January 2014, except for Python programmers which increased by 8.7%. In New York, Python developers ranked #8 of the most in-demand tech workers, making an average of $106k/year.  </p></li>
<li><p>It Works well Online:
Django — the popular open source web application framework written in Python — is the foundation of such sites as Pinterest, The New York Times, The Guardian, Bit Bucket, and Instagram. Django is a complete framework that takes the complexity out of web development while still giving you control over as much as you want.
Above is just some of the reason of why Python as my first programming language, the exercises we made on class were difficult enough for my math experience, while they helped me to understand how to break a large problem in to pieces, definitely a true experience! </p></li>
